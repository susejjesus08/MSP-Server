# Sets the maximum percentage of a tick that BetterStructures will use to paste builds, however many it maybe trying to generate.
# Ranges from 0.01 to 1, where 0.01 is 1% and 1 is 100%.
# Slower speeds will lower performance impact, but can lead to other problems such as builds suddenly popping in.

# Sets the maximum percentage of a tick that BetterStructures will use for world pregeneration when using the pregenerate command.
# Ranges from 0.01 to 1, where 0.01 is 1% and 1 is 100%.
# This controls how much of each server tick is dedicated to generating chunks, allowing you to balance generation speed with server performance.
# Lower values will generate chunks more slowly but reduce server lag, while higher values will generate faster but may impact server performance.
percentageOfTickUsedForPregeneration: 0.1
# The TPS threshold at which chunk pregeneration will pause to protect server performance.
# When server TPS drops below this value, pregeneration will pause until TPS recovers.
# Default: 12.0
pregenerationTPSPauseThreshold: 12.0
# The TPS threshold at which chunk pregeneration will resume after being paused.
# Pregeneration will only resume when server TPS is at or above this value.
# Should be higher than the pause threshold to prevent rapid pause/resume cycles.
# Default: 14.0
